#Cryptogram

This program contains different implementations of encryption algorithms implemented in C#.

Actually... their's only one available right now. 
It's the double transposition cipher which is wrapped inside a console application.
But more to come!!!

##Future plans
- Generating an abstract algorithm structure
- Implementing more encyrption algorithms
